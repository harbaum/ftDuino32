    <h2>ftDuino32 - Wifi Setup</h2>

    <p>The ESP32 CPU of the ftDuino32 includes WiFi capabilities and the ftDuino32
      can be integrated into a wireless network. The use of WiFi needs to be configured
      on the ftDuino32.</p>

    <h3>Starting the WiFi Setup</h3>

    <p>WiFi setup is started by launching the <tt>wifi_setup</tt>
      application on the ftDuino32. This will temporarily start a
      local WiFi network named <tt>ftDuino32-AP</tt>.</p>

    <h3>Accessing the local WiFi</h3>
    
    <p>The temporary local WiFi needs to be accessed by the device you
      are going to use to configure WiFi. E.g. on your smartphone
      select the WiFi network named <tt>ftDuino32-AP</tt>.</p>
    
    <img src="images/wifi_setup_select_ftduino32_ap.png" style="border: 5px solid #555;" />

    <p>You will be notified that this network does not give you
      internet access as it is limited to the ftDuino32 only.
      This is ok as this network is only used during setup.</p>

    <p>Once connected to the <tt>ftDuino32-AP</tt> network
      point your browser to the address the Wifi setup applocatgion
      on the ftDuino32 displays. In this case it's <tt>192.168.4.1</tt>.
      So used the browser to connect to <tt>http://192.168.4.1</tt>.
      This should result in the network config being displayed.</p>

    <p>Select the WiFi network you are going to use with the ftDuino32
      and enter the password of that network. Finally
      select <tt>Submit</tt>.</p>

    <p>The selected WiFi network will be submitted to the ftDuino32
      and stored in its internal configuration.</p>

    <p>Once the configuration is stored, the ftDuiono32 will restart
      and try to connect to the newly configured network. If
      successful the IP adress given by that network will be displays
      underneath the ftDuino32 logo.</p>
    
    <img src="images/wifi_setup_ip_set.jpg" style="border: 5px solid #555;" />

    <p>The ftDuino32 is now integrated into your Wifi network and the
      local network used during configuration is now being
      disabled.</p>

    <p>The ftDuino32 is now accessible from other devices in that WiFi
      network and can itself connect to services in the internet.</p>
